# Machine Learning Unit 1: K-Nearest-Neighbors

## Getting Started
Fork and clone this repo. Open a new terminal and navigate to this directory, and then run `jupyter notebook`. A new browser window will open, displaying this directory. Begin work on `k-nearest-neighbors.ipynb`. If you finish this notebook, you may move on to `extension-sklearn.ipynb`. 

*If you haven't installed the jupyter cli, open the Anaconda Navigator and select the Jupyter icon. From there, a new browser window will open, displaying a file tree. Navigate to this directory and open `k-nearest-neighbors.ipynb` to begin work.*
